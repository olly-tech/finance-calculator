# Finance Calculator Python Application

Project created as part of Hyperion Dev Skills Bootcamp.

Prompt: create a finance calculator, that allows a user access to two calculators. The user is presented with a menu to select the appropriate calculator for whether they wish to calculate their investment bonuses or their repayments on a house loan. 

This program utilises casting to ensure a user's input is recognised in multiple formats, for better UX.
